## Course's scope

At the end of the course, you should be a _hacker with k8s skillz_.

What does this means?

1. You should be able to create a k8s cluster on Hetzner
2. You should be able to add CI/CD to any project
3. You should have a good grasp of the basics of Observability (Grafana, Prometheus)

## Target audience

This course is meant for you if:

- you're a hacker
- you have 30 minutes to spare each week
- you're interested in k8s but could not really commit to learning it
- you want to feel at ease when dealing with k8s systems
- you're short on money and want to learn the cheap variant of k8s (not the Google Cloud or Amazon ones - even though your knowledge will transfer well)
- bonus: you are into scraping
