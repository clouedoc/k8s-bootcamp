## Target audience

This course is meant for you if:

- you're a hacker
- you have 30 minutes to spare each week
- you're interested in k8s but could not really commit to learning it
- you want to feel at ease when dealing with k8s systems
- you're short on money and want to learn the cheap variant of k8s (not the Google Cloud or Amazon ones - even though your knowledge will transfer well)
- bonus: you are into scraping
