# week 1 - commit your soul to k8s

## Criterions for success

You can consider this exercice as a success if you can tick all the following boxes:

- [ ] You have created a Beeminder account
- [ ] You have attached a credit card to your Beeminder account
- [ ] You have created the learn_k8s goal on Beeminder
- [ ] You have opened a pull request to this page that adds your public learn_k8s goal on the annex's list.

## Exercice

Today, we will ensure that you actually commit time to learning k8s every week.

To do so, we are going to use Beeminder, a service that will help you commit to a goal by charging you money if you don't reach it. Yes, I know that it's scary; but at least, you will be guaranteed that you will learn k8s.

### Create a Beeminder account

Go to [Beeminder](https://www.beeminder.com/) and create an account. You can use your GitHub account to sign up.

### Creating the goal

Once you have created your account, you will need to create a goal. A goal is a commitment to do something on a recurring basis. In our case, we will create a goal to learn k8s every week.

Steps:

1. Go to the [goal creation page](https://www.beeminder.com/new)
2. Pick "Add progress manually to Beeminder"
3. Pick "Do More" as the goal type
4. Set "1/7" as the daily quantity
5. Set "k8s exercices" as the unit
6. Toggle "Start with extra leeway" and put a 1 day buffer
7. Set "learn_k8s" as the goal name
8. Set "learn_k8s: do a k8s exercice" as the goal description
9. Wrap up, and finish creating the goal

### Make sure that you receive Beeminder notifications

Beeminder will send you emails so that you remember your goal, but I recommend that you either install the [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/beeminder/id551869729) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.beeminder.beeminder&hl=en_US) app.

If you're feeling fancy, you can add widgets to your home screen to motivate you!

### Adding your goal to this page

Now that you have created your goal, you will need to add it to this page. To do so, you will need to open a pull request.

Steps:

1. Open this page on GitHub
2. Click on the pencil icon on the top right of the page
3. Add your goal to the list of goals in the annex below
4. Commit your changes and open a pull request

### Congrats

Congrats! You can now go back to the beginning of the page and ensure that you are meeting the criterions for success. If you are, you can consider this exercice as a success and add +1 to your Beeminder goal.

I suggest that you take your week off and come back next week for the next exercice when Beeminder sends you a mail. Or you can also do a real exercice if you want to, but make sure to [ratchet](https://help.beeminder.com/article/56-can-i-get-rid-of-extra-safety-buffer) to avoid forgetting about k8s in a week ;)
